# Utilities for working with XML parsed with groovy's XmlParser #


Groovy's native `XmlParser` class is a fast and easy way to work with in-memory parses of XML data.  The `XmlUtils` class in this package provides methods for some common recursive tasks applied to the `groovy.util.Node` object created by groovy's `XmlParser`.
